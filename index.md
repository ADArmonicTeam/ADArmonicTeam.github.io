# Are Russian Trolls Good at their Jobs? The U.S. Presidential Elections: A Timeline Analysis


### Who Are the Russian Trolls?

It is currently under investigation whether during the 2016 U.S. elections a Russian 'troll factory', the IRA, released a number of tweets from fraudulent Twitter accounts. These tweets potentially influenced the population of voters by spreading statements, some of which were fake. The aim of this project is to better understand the strategy of the trolls by retrieving the main subjects of these tweets over time and categorizing them according to their targeted social, geographical, or political group. Quantifing the potential impact of those tweets and providing a link to specific events that were occuring in the United States at the time are the objectives.

### Gaining Popularity

The Trolls were able to gain the attention of the masses via various strategies.

1. One strategy was through exploiting popular and controversial events that occured either in America or internationally. As can be seen in the line plot below which ranges up to one year before the presidential election, there are distinct spikes that we have shown to be correlated to events.

2. A second strategy includes targetting specific populations of people. One of the most prominent that was found was that of the African-American population, which is a politically relevant community. Interestingly, when topic categorization was applied to analyze the types of tweets that were being released, the states which higher percentages of African-Americans correlated with the percent of Black-related tweets that were released by the Trolls.

3. Another strategy that was attempted was to reply to popular twitter authors such as **midnight** that are followed by a significant proportion of the American people. However, given the fact that only individuals who follow both the Troll who replied *and* the author to which the reply was made can see the reply, this tactic may have not been the best in terms of gaining an audience. For this reason the number of replies remains relatively low. (Does it drop off as time goes by?)
